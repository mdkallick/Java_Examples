need to write the first half of my writeup--see if I can find that sheet of notes, it should come in handy
ask someone about that--should I add stuff as I go along, or would it be better to note that I missed something and come back to it later?
Need to add some form of turn implementation
add all the parameters that turn on and off buttons
change heights of the two hands so that they match up a little better with the field (or not, this is not necessarily the best look for the program
add a help button
add the changeX and changeY to the buttonClicked method
add the attackCard and attackPlayer methods
