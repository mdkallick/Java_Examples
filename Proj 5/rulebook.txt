Plans for project 5:
-Builders, trees, and wooden obstacles.
-The builders get wood from trees, which generate wood at a given rate.
-They then move randomly for a given number of turns, (8)
after which they spawn ('build') an obstacle. They then begin looking for more wood.
-If they can't find wood within a certain number of turns, They become unemployed(despawn).
As a beginning rulebook:
-builders have 10 life, and lose one life each turn without wood.
-builders gain two lives by getting wood.
-trees generate 1 wood every 4 turns, and die if they ever go down to 0 wood.
-obstacles are limited to 1/5 of the total landscape space (the oldest despawn 
if more are made).
-trees spawn new trees if they have more than 5 wood and there is a tree near them,
1% of the time.
builders spawn new builders if they have wood and a builder near them, 1% of the time.
